# deterministic-mac-manager

This is for those that hate re-setting up their dev environment.

## Why?

There are three things I would want to deterministically set back up on a new system install:

- Applications
- Custom Mac OS settings
- Settings in plain files, like dotfiles (.bashrc, etc.)

There are four things I want to do, but are not the Beta goal:

- Checking for changes in the Mac Environment
- Custom settings configured in those applications
- Logging into those applications
- Sharing/displaying all these settings in a UI

## How
